# For input alphabet: Σ = { 0, 1, 2 } machine replace all
# '2110' sequences to '0000' sequence.

### Initial Input: $001211000211100002110112100$

q0 2 * > q2         # possibly start '2110' sequence
q0 * * > q1         # for rest of values, move right to 'q1'
q0 _ _ * stop-q0    # end

q1 2 * > q2         # next of '2110' sequence character (2)
q1 _ * * q0         # for blank symbol, move to beginning
q1 * * > q1         # for rest of values, recursion
	
q2 1 * > q3         # next of '2110' sequence character (1)
q2 _ * * q0         # for blank symbol, move to beginning
q2 * * > q2         # for rest of values, recursion

q3 1 * > q4         # next of '2110' sequence character (1)
q3 * * > q2         # for rest of values, move to 'q2'

q4 0 0 < q5         # next of '2110' sequence character (0) - sequence is match to '2110'
q4 * * > q2         # for rest of values, move to 'q2'

q5 * 0 < q5         # replace all sequence elements to '0'
q5 2 0 > q0         # goto start
